# Phase 1: Sending Data with Fetch

This project demonstrates how to use the `fetch()` API to send POST requests to a JSON server and handle the responses. The application allows users to submit data (name and email) to the server and displays the server's response or error messages on the webpage.

## Features

- Sends a POST request to a JSON server with user data (name and email).
- Displays the server's response, including the newly created user ID, on the webpage.
- Handles errors gracefully and displays error messages on the webpage.
